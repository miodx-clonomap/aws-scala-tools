* Updated aws java sdk from `v1.9.26` to `v1.10.32`
* Most of the changes are related to EC2:
    - introduced a datatype for AMI with region, virtualization, storage type members
    - moved `ohnosequences.awstools.ec2.Utils` to the `ohnosequences.awstools.ec2` package object
    - renamed `Tag` to `InstanceTag`
    - renamed `Filter` to (Any)`InstanceFilter`
    - separated `InstanceSpecs` with AMI and InstanceType members
    - introduced `AnyInstanceType` with more detailed type hierarchy
    - renamed `InstanceSpecs` to `LaunchSpecs`
    - now `InstanceSpecs` combines an AMI with instance type while checking their compatibility
