* Updated aws java sdk from `v1.9.26` to `v1.10.37`
* Most of the other changes are related to EC2 and AutoScaling (note, some of them are **breaking**):
    - introduced a **datatype for AMI** with region, virtualization, storage type members (using `2015.09.1` version in this release)
    - moved `ohnosequences.awstools.ec2.Utils` to the `ohnosequences.awstools.ec2` package object
    - renamed `Tag` to `InstanceTag`
    - renamed `Filter` to (Any)`InstanceFilter`
    - separated `InstanceSpecs` with AMI and InstanceType members
    - introduced `AnyInstanceType` with more detailed type hierarchy
    - renamed `InstanceSpecs` to `LaunchSpecs`
    - now `InstanceSpecs` combines an AMI with instance type while checking their compatibility
    - added `AutoScalingGroupSize` to the `AutoScalingGroup` constructor
